        content: `Superannuation is Australia's retirement savings system designed to provide income during retirement. Here are the key components:

**How It Works:**
- Mandatory contributions from your employer (currently 11% of salary)
- Voluntary additional contributions you can make
- Government co-contributions for eligible individuals
- Tax advantages to encourage long-term savings

**Key Benefits:**
- Compounding growth over decades
- Tax-advantaged environment
- Professional fund management
- Insurance coverage options

**Types of Contributions:**
1. **Employer Contributions**: Mandatory 11% of your salary
2. **Salary Sacrifice**: Pre-tax contributions from your salary
3. **After-tax Contributions**: Personal contributions from your take-home pay
4. **Government Co-contribution**: Up to $500 matching for eligible earners

**Important Limits:**
- Concessional cap: $27,500 per year (2023-24)
- Non-concessional cap: $110,000 per year
- Total superannuation balance affects contribution caps

Understanding these basics is crucial for making informed decisions about your retirement future.`

**Concessional Contributions Cap: $27,500**
- Includes employer contributions
- Salary sacrifice contributions
- Personal deductible contributions
- Taxed at 15% in super fund

**Non-concessional Contributions Cap: $110,000**
- After-tax personal contributions
- Not taxed on entry to super fund
- Can bring forward up to 3 years ($330,000)

**Excess Contributions:**
- Concessional excess: Taxed at marginal rate minus 15%
- Non-concessional excess: Taxed at 47% or can be withdrawn

**Strategies:**
- Use carry-forward unused concessional cap space
- Time contributions around financial year end
- Consider spouse splitting strategies
- Monitor total superannuation balance impacts`

        content: `Selecting the right super fund can significantly impact your retirement outcome:

**Key Factors to Consider:**

**1. Fees and Costs:**
- Administration fees (annual and monthly)
- Investment fees (typically 0.50% - 2.00%)
- Insurance premiums
- Exit fees and switching costs

**2. Investment Options:**
- Range of investment choices
- Asset allocation options

**3. Performance:**
- Long-term returns (10+ years)
- Risk-adjusted performance
- Consistency across market cycles
- Benchmark comparisons

**4. Services:**
- Online platform quality
- Financial advice access
- Insurance options
- Member benefits and tools

**5. Fund Size and Stability:**
- Assets under management
- Member numbers
- Fund history and stability
- Merger and acquisition activity

**Types of Funds:**
- Industry funds (non-profit)
- Retail funds (for-profit)

Take time to research and compare - the difference in fees and performance can mean hundreds of thousands in your final balance.`

        description: 'How to balance your investment portfolio',
        duration: '6 min read',
        type: 'article',
        content: `Asset allocation is one of the most important investment decisions you'll make:

**Core Asset Classes:**

**1. Growth Assets (Higher Risk/Return):**
- Australian shares (20-40% typical allocation)
- International shares (20-35% typical allocation)
- Property/REITs (5-15% typical allocation)

**2. Defensive Assets (Lower Risk/Return):**
- Fixed income/bonds (10-30% typical allocation)
- Cash and term deposits (0-10% typical allocation)

**Age-Based Allocation Rules:**
- Conservative: 100 - Age = Growth assets percentage
- Moderate: 110 - Age = Growth assets percentage
- Aggressive: 120 - Age = Growth assets percentage

**Example for 35-year-old:**
- Conservative: 65% growth, 35% defensive
- Moderate: 75% growth, 25% defensive
- Aggressive: 85% growth, 15% defensive

**Rebalancing Strategy:**
- Review allocation quarterly
- Rebalance when drift exceeds 5%
- Consider tax implications
- Use new contributions for rebalancing

**Lifecycle Investing:**
- Start aggressive when young
- Gradually reduce risk approaching retirement
- Consider target-date funds for automatic adjustment

Remember: Time in the market beats timing the market for long-term investors.`

        description: 'The benefits of regular, consistent investing',
        duration: '4 min read',
        type: 'article',
        content: `Dollar-cost averaging is a powerful strategy built into superannuation:

**How It Works:**
- Regular contributions regardless of market conditions
- Buy more units when prices are low
- Buy fewer units when prices are high
- Smooths out market volatility over time

**Benefits:**
1. **Reduces timing risk** - No need to predict market movements
2. **Emotional discipline** - Removes fear and greed from decisions
3. **Lower average cost** - Mathematical advantage in volatile markets
4. **Automatic process** - Employer contributions happen automatically

**Real Example:**
Monthly contribution: $500
- Month 1: $500 buys 50 units at $10 each
- Month 2: $500 buys 100 units at $5 each  
- Month 3: $500 buys 25 units at $20 each
- Average cost: $8.57 per unit vs average price $11.67

**Maximizing the Strategy:**
- Increase contributions during market downturns
- Stay consistent through all market cycles
- Avoid stopping contributions during volatility
- Consider additional voluntary contributions

**Superannuation Advantage:**
Your employer contributions happen automatically, providing perfect dollar-cost averaging without any effort on your part.`

        content: `Understanding different types of investment risk helps you make better decisions:

**Types of Risk:**

**1. Market Risk:**
- Systematic risk affecting all investments
- Cannot be diversified away
- Examples: Global financial crisis, pandemic impacts

**2. Specific Risk:**
- Risk specific to individual companies/sectors
- Can be reduced through diversification
- Examples: Company bankruptcy, industry disruption

**3. Inflation Risk:**
- Risk that returns won't keep pace with inflation
- Particularly affects fixed-income investments
- Long-term average inflation ~2-3% annually

**4. Liquidity Risk:**
- Risk of not being able to sell investments quickly
- Generally low for super due to long-term nature
- Important for emergency access needs

**5. Currency Risk:**
- Risk from international investment exposure
- Australian dollar movements affect returns
- Can be hedged but at a cost

**Risk Management Strategies:**

**Diversification:**
- Spread investments across asset classes
- Geographic diversification
- Sector diversification
- Time diversification (long investment period)

**Risk Tolerance Assessment:**
- Consider your age and time to retirement
- Emotional capacity for volatility
- Financial capacity for potential losses
- Recovery time from major losses

**Risk vs. Return Trade-off:**
- Higher potential returns require accepting higher risk
- Conservative investments provide stability but lower returns
- The key is finding the right balance for your situation

Remember: The biggest risk for young investors is being too conservative and not allowing enough time for growth.`
